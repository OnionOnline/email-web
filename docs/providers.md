# Providers

The Onion Email service is not limited to any e-mail provider. You can use it with any e-mail provider you want. The only requirement is that you can set up a redirection rule for your e-mail address.

## Currently supported providers with the e-mail aliases

- [Gmail](https://gmail.com)
- [Outlook](https://outlook.com)
- [Yahoo](https://yahoo.com)
- [AOL](https://aol.com)

> We are happy to add more providers to the list. If you would like to add your provider, please contact us at [contact@onion.email](mailto:contact@onion.email?key=https%3A%2F%2Fkeys.openpgp.org%2Fvks%2Fv1%2Fby-fingerprint%2FF670A2D3626AB878A46D7AA8879FF4E05B438A11).

Alias is not required to operate the Onion Email service but without one, you will not be able to send emails from your Onion Email address.

## How to set up redirection?

To set up redirection, best will be to ask ChatGPT bot for help. Seriously.

For most providers the process is straight forward.

Here are the examples for [Gmail](/docs/guide/create-an-alias#create-an-alias-with-gmail) and [Outlook](/docs/guide/create-an-alias#create-an-alias-with-outlook).
