Onion Email is the Ultimate layer of privacy protection for your online communications.

## What you will get with the service?

You will get:

- A secure email address redirection to your current email address

## How the service is working?

The service is working as follows:

2. Approve the creation of the address by clicking on the link in the email sent to your email address.
3. Generate a GPG/PGP key pair and upload your public key to a public key server.
4. Establish a redirection rule within your email service to enable sending emails from your Onion Email address alias (optional).
